                                <p>Founded in 1911 and headquartered in Michigan, Whirlpool has been an American’s 
                                golden child appliance manufacturer. Throughout the years, Whirlpool has been a 
                                company that we generally recommend for dishwashers, fridges, dryers, and ovens. 
                                They are also the parent company to Maytag, Jennair, and Kitchen-Aid.</p>

                            <div class="int-text">
                                <p>GE is a multi-nation, multi-division company based out of Boston. GE’s appliance division 
                                has been hit or miss over the years and sometimes seems like an afterthought when it comes 
                                to greater company products. GE engineering on their appliances is notorious for changing up 
                                the game and updating appliances with new features and better looks, sometimes at the 
                                determinant of quality. The cooking lines are generally above average over the years.</p>
                                <div class="descr-pr">
                                    <span>Common Issues</span>
                                    <p>&#129170 GE has had multiple issues with any appliances that use water. Dishwashers, fridges, 
                                    and washers usually fight us tooth and nail to diagnose. This doesn’t necessarily mean 
                                    they are bad products, but rather lead to longer diagnosis times.</p>
                                    <p>&#129170 GE is often said as “generally expensive” around the office because 
                                    their parts are more expensive than other brands.</p>
                                    <p>&#129170 French door style fridges almost always develop a fridge fan issue. This is 
                                    usually resolved by an update and a new fan motor.</p>
                                    <p>&#129170 Ge Dishwashers are engineered with poor cleaning performance, which 
                                    results in unsatisfied customers.</p>
                                    <p>&#129170 Like the dishwashers, GE washers often have a drain, control board, and motor issues. 
                                    These lead to very costly repairs early on in their life span.</p>

                                They make everything from your phone to your fridge. They have expanded their market 
                                share by joining the appliance game only recently.</p>

                                    <p>&#129170 Due to poor quality control issues in manufacturing, their compressors and sealed systems in their 
                                    fridges are not great. The average life span on a refrigerator before it needs considerable 
                                    repair is only a couple of years.</p>
                                    <p>&#129170 Some bearing issues with front load washers happen, but they aren’t any worse than anyone else in the market. 
                                    This issue seems to be just avoidable at this point, no matter what brand you select.</p>
                                    <p>&#129170 Samsung makes beautiful appliances with loads of features, and with that comes multiple fail points. 
                                    Often they over-promise with a long list of features at the expense of quality.</p>
